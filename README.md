*Colos* is a minimal, multilingual theme for *[Hexo](http://hexo.io/ "A fast, simple & powerful blog framework")*.

Features
--------

### To do

- Multilingual support.
- Material design.
- Color everywhere!
- Different layouts.

Live demo
---------

There's a single language demo project in [hexo-theme-colos-demo](https://github.com/ahaasler/hexo-theme-colos-demo "Demo site for the colos theme") \[[live demo](http://colos.adrianhaasler.com/ "Colos")\],
and a multilingual demo project in [hexo-theme-colos-multilingual-demo](https://github.com/ahaasler/hexo-theme-colos-multilingual-demo "Multilingual demo site for the colos theme") \[[multilingual live demo](http://colos-multi.adrianhaasler.com/ "Colos")\].

The theme is currently in alpha stages, that means that it has no style yet (looks plain and default). I'm working in migrating the multilingual features to plugins, see [\#4](https://github.com/ahaasler/hexo-theme-colos/issues/4 "Generators should be separated from theme").
