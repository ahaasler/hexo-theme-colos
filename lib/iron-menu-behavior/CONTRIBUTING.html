<h3 id="Filing_Issues"><a href="#Filing_Issues" class="headerlink" title="Filing Issues"></a>Filing Issues</h3><p><strong>If you are filing an issue to request a feature</strong>, please provide a clear description of the feature. It can be helpful to describe answers to the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Who will use the feature?</strong> <em>“As someone filling out a form…”</em></li>
<li><strong>When will they use the feature?</strong> <em>“When I enter an invalid value…”</em></li>
<li><strong>What is the user’s goal?</strong> <em>“I want to be visually notified that the value needs to be corrected…”</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>If you are filing an issue to report a bug</strong>, please provide:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>A clear description of the bug and related expectations.</strong> Consider using the following example template for reporting a bug:</p>
<p><code>``markdown
The</code>paper-foo` element causes the page to turn pink when clicked.</p>
<h2 id="Expected_outcome"><a href="#Expected_outcome" class="headerlink" title="Expected outcome"></a>Expected outcome</h2><p>The page stays the same color.</p>
<h2 id="Actual_outcome"><a href="#Actual_outcome" class="headerlink" title="Actual outcome"></a>Actual outcome</h2><p>The page turns pink.</p>
<h2 id="Steps_to_reproduce"><a href="#Steps_to_reproduce" class="headerlink" title="Steps to reproduce"></a>Steps to reproduce</h2></li>
<li><p>Put a <code>paper-foo</code> element in the page.</p>
</li>
<li>Open the page in a web browser.</li>
<li><p>Click the <code>paper-foo</code> element.<br>```</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>A reduced test case that demonstrates the problem.</strong> If possible, please include the test case as a JSBin. Start with this template to easily import and use relevant Polymer Elements: <a href="https://jsbin.com/cagaye/edit?html,output">https://jsbin.com/cagaye/edit?html,output</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>A list of browsers where the problem occurs.</strong> This can be skipped if the problem is the same across all browsers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Submitting_Pull_Requests"><a href="#Submitting_Pull_Requests" class="headerlink" title="Submitting Pull Requests"></a>Submitting Pull Requests</h3><p><strong>Before creating a pull request</strong>, please ensure that an issue exists for the corresponding change in the pull request that you intend to make. <strong>If an issue does not exist, please create one per the guidelines above</strong>. The goal is to discuss the design and necessity of the proposed change with Polymer authors and community before diving into a pull request.</p>
<p>When submitting pull requests, please provide:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>A reference to the corresponding issue</strong> or issues that will be closed by the pull request. Please refer to these issues in the pull request description using the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="markdown">(For a single issue)
Fixes #20

(For multiple issues)
Fixes #32, fixes #40
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>A succinct description of the design</strong> used to fix any related issues. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="markdown">This fixes #20 by removing styles that leaked which would cause the page to turn pink whenever <span class="code">`paper-foo`</span> is clicked.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>At least one test for each bug fixed or feature added</strong> as part of the pull request. Pull requests that fix bugs or add features without accompanying tests will not be considered.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If a proposed change contains multiple commits, please <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-11-08-how-to-squash-commits-in-a-github-pull-request">squash commits</a> to as few as is necessary to succinctly express the change. A Polymer author can help you squash commits, so don’t be afraid to ask us if you need help with that!</p>
